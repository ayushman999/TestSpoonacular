# TestSpoonacular
An app to get recipes suggestion from your current list of ingredients.
This application is a perfect example to know about using custom made array adapter and how to 
fetch data from an api and how to display it on your application.
The api that I used is from a website called Spoonacular [link:](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Search-Recipes-by-Ingredients)
